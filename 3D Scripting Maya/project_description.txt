Project â€“ Flower Power script

  You will take the flower builder script flowerPetal.mel and convert it to python and extend its functionality. flowerPetal.mel creates a pretty flower. Specifically Project 2 consists of the following steps:

      i. Convert flowerPetal.mel to flowerPetal,py
      ii. Color the procedurally generated flowers using scripted shaders
      iii. Propose an animation of flowerPetal,py and implement your procedural animation of the flowers script.
